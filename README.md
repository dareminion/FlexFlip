# FlexFlip
Created as a design project for Introduction to Engineering and Design (EG-1004)

Design Phase


As a team, we wanted to prototype something that would be useful and helpful for people. The idea for FlexFlip came about when thinking about how light switches can be inaccessible for some, and automatic light switches can be expensive for many. For the mechanism, we decided on a rotational motor that would turn on and off the light switch. The device would have two types of input, through remote control or motion sensing. It was also important to make it as compatible as possible so that it would work with as many switch types as possible.

When Designing the electrical ciruit, the amount of space that the components took up was extremely valuable as we wanted the device to be as small as possible. Both sensors would need to connect back to the Arduino and would active the rotional servo motor separately. The diagram below shows how connections were made and does not show the final circuit.

Assembly Phase

The first step in our assembly process was to create the circuit to get a better grasp of what dimensions our box would be. After assembling the basic circuitry, the first steps in the softtware would be developed.

For the first prototype, a wooden box would be used, the final design would use acryllic for the case material. We decided on an interlocking mechanism for better structural integrity. Later deisgns would also incorporate holes one one side for the servo motor to function alongside cutouts for the IR sensors.

Final Prototype

As we reached the final product, we laser cut a box with acrylic and 3D printed a base for us to mount components to. We also had to swtich to a different Arduino and used a smaller breadboard to make the design more compact. The lever arm connected to the servo motor was also 3D-Printed, and since multiple 3D prints failed, we resorted to using a piece of wood from out first prototype box to increase the surface area.
